/*
**you gotta have something in between mongoDB & javaScript application and that's your API that you build with node.js and express.js to get data from mongoDB and make it available in a asynchronous way to your client/javascript application

Our progression path
-Intro to AJAX
-XMLHttpRequest Object
    -Loading XML Data
    -Loading JSON Data
    -Using Web APIs
-Promises
-The Fetch API
-Async/Await
-Making Cross Origin Requests

AJAX (partial page refresh)
-stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Extensible Markup Language - data transport layer, you can make up your own tags), to send AJAX requestion - JavaScript uses either traditional XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object or Fetch API which is like a candy wrpper for XHR object
-common data formats for working w/ AJAX are HTML (uncommon), XML (rarely used anymore, defines the data that the tags contain) - extensible markup language is open-standard device independent format that must be parsed by JavaScript in the browser, JSON (very common) - JavaScript Object Notation is now most popular format for AJAX apps. JSON files are faster and smaller than XML files & are easier to parse since JSON data is returned in native JavaScript objects
